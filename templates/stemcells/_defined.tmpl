  BOSH produces official <a href="/docs/stemcell.html">stemcells</a> for
  popular operating systems and infrastructures. For infrastructures that
  support it, <a href="/docs/build-stemcell/#light-stemcells">light
  stemcells</a> are a more efficient way to reference stemcells that we have
  pre-uploaded and shared within the IaaS.
